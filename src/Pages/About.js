              While a generous amount of Mothman information already exists on
              the web, there lacks a centralized database of Mothman
              sightings. The Moth Maps project aims to collect and curate
              Mothman reports from all around the world.

              Using the latest in mapping technology, the Moth Maps Project
              provides a simple way to submit and track information pertaining
              to one's encounter with The Mothman.

            <p className="lead">
              Anyone is free to report a Mothman sighting, and is encouraged
              to do so. After review and approval by an administrator of the
              Moth Man project, your story will become available for the rest
              of the web to see.
